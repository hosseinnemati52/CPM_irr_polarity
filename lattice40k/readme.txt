This folder contains the data of the lattice.
They are read by the simulation codes in each folder "run_1", "run_2" and so on.
These data includes the center points used for Voronoi tessellation (test.dat), 
the center of mass of Voronoi polygons (siteComXY.csv), 
the size of the box (LxLy.dat), 
the edge lengths (walls.dat),
the area of each lattice site (vols.dat),
the vertices coordinates of each lattice site polygon (vertices.dat),
the inertia momenta of lattice sites, i.e., Ixx, Iyy, Ixy (I_info_array.csv).
